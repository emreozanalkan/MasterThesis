Use consistent and clear fonts through all the document.
% The text layout should be approximately as follows: • 4cm binding margin
% • 2cm head margin (top of page)
% • 2.5cm fore-edge margin
% • 4cm tail margin (bottom of page)

Operating room management and surgical procedure evaluation are time consuming tasks for operating room managers and clinicians. The demanding workload can be reduced thanks to context-aware system that use signals and data from operating rooms to automate processes such as surgical skill analysis, transcription of medical produces and evaluation of quality of procedures. Activity recognition is one of the key factors to enable the context-aware systems in the operating rooms. In this work, we address the problem of activity recognition in an operating room using a multi-view RGBD camera system. We adopt the activity recognition pipeline based on bag-of-words approach by \cite{twinanda2015data} and extend it with a 4D spatio-temporal voting scheme.  In the recognition pipeline, a data-driven non-rigid layout is learnt to divide the 4D spatio-temporal space of the features into 4D patches in order to recover the information loss caused by the bag-of-words approach. Since each patch from the learnt layout carries meaningful and semantic information of the 4D spatio-temporal space for an activity, the proposed voting scheme collects votes from the patches to determine the activity. We tested the proposed method on a multi-view RGBD dataset \cite{twinanda2015data} using two classifiers, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). We also compare the results of the proposed voting scheme approach to the non-voting approach \cite{twinanda2015data}. The experiments show that the proposed voting scheme shows promising results with 83.1\% accuracy.

% Operating room is a very important place where resource management and evaluation are very critical. Operating room management and evaluation bring many critical responsibilities such as surgical skill analysis, transcription of medical produces and evaluation of quality of procedures which cause high workload to clinicians and operating room managers. The high workload on operating room staff can be reduced  thanks to context-aware systems that use signals and data from operating rooms to automate processes. Activity recognition is indeed one of the key factors to enable the context-aware systems in the operating rooms. In this work, we address the problem of activity recognition in an operating room using a multi-view RGBD camera system. We adopt the activity recognition pipeline based on bag-of-words approach by \cite{twinanda2015data} and extend it with a 4D spatio-temporal voting scheme.  In the recognition pipeline, a data-driven non-rigid layout is learnt to divide the 4D spatio-temporal space of the features into 4D patches in order to recover the information loss caused by the bag-of-words approach. Since each patch from the learnt layout carries meaningful and semantic information of the 4D spatio-temporal space for an activity, the proposed voting scheme collects votes from the patches to determine the activity. We tested the proposed method on a multi-view RGBD dataset \cite{twinanda2015data} using various classifiers, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). We also compare results of the proposed voting scheme approach to the non-voting approach \cite{twinanda2015data}. The experiments shows that the proposed voting scheme shows promising results with 83.1\% accuracy.
